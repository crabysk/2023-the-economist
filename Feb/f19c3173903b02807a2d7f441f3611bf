A YEAR ON from Russia’s invasion, Joe Biden has made it clear: America’s backing for Ukraine “will not waver”. But Ukraine needs more than strong words. Does America have the will and the means to back Ukraine for as long as it takes? And what does its commitment in Europe mean for America’s readiness to help defend allies elsewhere? The Economist’s Anton La Guardia tells us how the battle in Ukraine compares to other recent conflicts. The Economist’s Jon Fasman visits a munitions plant in Pennsylvania. And Commandant of the United States Marine Corps General David Berger considers the prospect of war in the Pacific. John Prideaux hosts with Charlotte Howard and Idrees Kahloon.
