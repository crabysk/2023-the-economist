QUANTITATIVE INVESTORS are known for their cool, mathematical approach to investing. They build models which search for patterns across huge data sets to discern where they should invest. The frenzied “bubble in everything” wrongfooted many quants in 2020–but the stock markets return to Earth, which crippled many traditional funds, generated huge returns for the quants in 2022. Nowhere was this clearer than in the performance of AQR Capital Management, a quant fund run by Cliff Asness. Its long-running strategy returned 43.5% last year, net of fees. On this week’s podcast, hosts Alice Fulwood, Tom Lee-Devlin and Mike Bird speak to Cliff Asness, the co-founder and chief investment officer of AQR, one of the world’s biggest quant fund managers. He tells them why he’s more open than his competitors and what still keeps him up at night.
