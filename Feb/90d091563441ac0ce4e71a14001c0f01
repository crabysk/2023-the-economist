CHINA’S COMMUNIST PARTY declared a “decisive victory” against the pandemic last week, arguing that the country’s response to the virus has been a “miracle in human history.” We travel to four cities that have all played important roles in China’s covid policies and examine the effects of the lockdowns that took place in each of them. The Economist’s Beijing bureau chief, David Rennie, and senior China correspondent, Alice Su, talk to Gabriel Crossley, The Economist’s China correspondent. He traveled to Ruili, a border city in Southern China, to see how the local government leveraged the pandemic to build a border fence. We also hear from Don Weinland, our China business and finance editor in Shanghai, who has been speaking to business owners about the country’s economic recovery.
