Just weeks ago, Gautam Adani was the third richest person in the world. But he was caught short when Hindenburg Research, a small American short-seller, issued a report that spooked investors, wiping $100bn from the value of Adani firms. On this week’s podcast, hosts Mike Bird, Alice Fulwood and Tom Lee-Devlin examine the allegations levelled at Adani’s firms, which the company has forcefully denied. The Economist’s Mumbai bureau chief, Tom Easton, talks them through Hindenburg’s report and Adani’s response. Analyst Mahesh Vyas considers the impact on Adani’s ability to borrow to fund infrastructure projects. And short-seller Andrew Left describes what it’s like to hit send on a report that’s intended to crash a firm’s stock price.
