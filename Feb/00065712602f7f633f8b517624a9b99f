The ocean’s chemistry is changing at an unprecedented rate. By the end of this century the ocean is expected to be 150% more acidic than it is now. Acidification is threatening marine life. It’s killing baby oysters, deep-sea coral reefs and pteropods, tiny creatures, known as the potato chips of the sea. Human livelihoods are also in jeopardy. This film explores the alarming effects of ocean acidification, drawing on the expertise of scientists and the first-hand experiences of a Native Alaskan community. The film also looks at what can be done to lessen the problem.
