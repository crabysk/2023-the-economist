AmericaN success has a way of flustering Europe into bad policies. Search engines are one dispiriting example. As Google and Yahoo dominated the internet in the early 2000s, Jacques Chirac, then president of France, beseeched Europe to “go on the offensive” so that America would not dominate “the power of tomorrow”. With the EU’s assent, France poured around €100m (roughly $147m back then) into Quaero, a would-be rival to America’s giants. Predictably the venture was dubbed “Eurogoogle”. Equally predictably, the big firms and public outfits that pocketed the money frittered it all away. Whoever Google’s rivals are today, they are not from Europe. Those curious to find out what happened to Quaero can ask Google, or a chatbot. These days it is green technology that is “the power of tomorrow”, and Europe once again fears America is leaving it in the dust. The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in August, offers at least $400bn of public money over ten years to accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy and electric vehicles. America’s carbon-cutting ambitions were at first lauded by the EU. But the penny swiftly dropped. The new subsidies come with a protectionist tinge; they are targeted at stuff that is mostly made in America, in a bid to shift supply chains there. Robert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister, fretted that valuable green investment will be “sucked away” from Europe across the Atlantic. Quaero ended up merely incinerating a pile of public cash. A botched response this time around could be far costlier. Wasteful EU copycat subsidies are on the cards. Worse, a plethora of tried-and-known-to-fail economic policies have been dusted off to counter the manageable threat posed by the IRA. These would steer Europe away from the free-trading open economic approach favoured by northern Europeans—including Britain, when it played a key role in steering the EU—and which currently prevails. The new path would have a distinctively French feel. At its core is a dirigiste industrial policy, where ministers dole out subsidies to favoured “national champions” protected from pesky imports. For decades this misguided approach has been banned by the EU, which feared beggar-thy-neighbour subsidy races within the union. The “state aid” rules that underpin the single market are designed to ensure that businesses in any of the union’s 27 countries compete on a level playing field. Consumers have benefited massively from what is among the eu’s best policies. But the supposed need to respond to the IRA in kind has given an opening to those who prefer less market and more political meddling. This is all the more worrisome as anti-subsidy rules were softened in 2020 to help navigate the response to covid-19, and then again last year to deal with the energy crisis. The alliance in favour of driving a horse and carriage through the state-aid rules includes Germany and France—a duo that often gets its way in EU matters. They want Europe to counter American subsidies with its own. But because the bloc itself lacks the resources to fund such industrial largesse centrally (without an increase in its budget, which is not on the cards), it will come down to national governments to splurge on corporate bungs. State-aid rules would thus have to go. This line of thinking has alarmed many in the rest of the EU, as will be evident at a summit of national leaders in Brussels on February 9th. Small countries worry they will be unable to match the largesse of Paris or Berlin, and so will see their companies fall behind. Italy, a big industrial country with bad public finances, is among those that know they will also be unable to keep up. They make for sizeable opposition to French and German plans, which might not carry the day as a result. Yet there is no need for Europe to scrap the policy that has underpinned its economic success. The Biden administration’s me-first approach is no friendly act to Europe. But the supposed threats posed by the IRA are overstated. A dollar spent in developing a battery plant in Kentucky does not preclude a euro being invested in Austria, no matter what European chief executives goading politicians into fattening their bottom lines might claim. Technology pioneered in America at great expense will also be available in Europe—just as Google is, for example. The need for green industrial products is so great that factories will have to be built on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr Biden is willing to pay dearly to juice America’s industrial base as much for geopolitical reasons as economic ones: he wants to “decouple” certain supply chains from China so as not to depend on it for future goods. Europe has little need to duplicate that effort so long as it has alternative suppliers to China available—something the IRA, by subsidising American production, makes more likely. America is spending lavishly on cutting carbon in part because it lacks policies that allow it to cut emissions more cheaply. It is stuffing businesses and consumers with subsidies because they currently have no incentive to go green: try selling an electric vehicle to someone paying $4 per gallon of petrol. Europe has already nudged its economy onto a more ecological path—motorists there pay the equivalent of $7 per gallon, for one thing. Europe, unlike America, already often charges firms for the carbon they spew as part of their operations. The incentives for owners and managers to green their businesses already exist. EU policymakers should stick to their existing, unFrench approach. There is lots Europe could be doing to improve its economic prospects. The single market should be deepened—for example when it comes to capital markets—not hobbled. Productivity could be raised with better training and education. Anaemic spending on research & development should be boosted. That is less exciting than showering shiny new industries with public money. It has the distinctive advantage of being known to work. Try Quaeroing it. ■ Read more from Charlemagne, our columnist on European politics:At last, populism in Europe is losing its mojo (Feb 2nd)Experience from a past crisis suggests Europe should shake off any complacency (Jan 26th)Europe’s “neutral” countries are having to adapt to the new world (Jan 19th)
