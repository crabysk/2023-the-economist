MORE AND more universities across America now require would-be professors to submit so-called diversity statements. These ask applicants to set out their commitment to, and experience of, promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. At the same time some Republican-led states, most notably Florida, are putting their own restrictions on academia. How healthy is academic freedom in America? Dean of Berkeley Law Erwin Chemerinsky makes the case for diversity statements, while NYUâ€™s Jonathan Haidt argues against them. We go back to when professors took a stand against anti-communism.
