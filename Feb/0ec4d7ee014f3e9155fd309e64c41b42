Despite wars, political instability and global financial turmoil, Israel’s economy has been a steady success. Bar a blip in 2020, it has grown by almost 4% a year since 1996. Binyamin Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving prime minister, has been in charge for much of this. He likes to take credit for the boom. Israel’s business bosses have allowed him to do so. No longer. His new government’s plans to overhaul Israel’s legal system, eroding the Supreme Court’s independence and limiting its power to hold the executive to account, have prompted ire from his more predictable foes, including his political opponents and the judiciary. Now the country’s economists and business leaders are chiming in too, warning that he may endanger the country’s prosperity. In an open letter to Mr Netanyahu, two former central-bank governors told him that by weakening the court’s independence he risks making Israel less attractive to foreign investors, driving down its credit ratings. “There is a correlation between processes which seem unconnected, like the judiciary’s ability to review the government, and trust in the economy, which affects economic performance,” they argued. The prime minister’s proposals, they cautioned, could damage Israel’s economy. Their warnings were echoed by another letter from 370 Israeli economists. Similar missives have been sent by business leaders and investors in the tech sector, which in 2021 accounted for 54% of Israel’s exports of goods and services. On January 24th around 1,000 tech workers at various firms in a number of towns held their first-ever strike in protest against the proposals. They walked out carrying signs saying “No Democracy—No High-Tech”. Some tech entrepreneurs have gone further, announcing that they are transferring their funds abroad. For an industry that fought for decades to bring foreign investment into Israel and took pride in keeping its research centres there, even when fledgling firms were bought up by foreign companies, this is unprecedented. “The Israeli high-tech sector has been seen as a role model of professionalism by investors and startups,” says Fiona Darmon, a venture capitalist in Jerusalem. “A professional and independent legal system is a bedrock for this.” The techies’ concerns are not just financial. They reflect the ideological and social rifts within Israel that are behind the protests against the government. People in the tech sector hail overwhelmingly from Israel’s middle class, which is mainly secular. Backers of Mr Netanyahu’s coalition tend to be more religious and working-class. The government is not only trying to weaken the liberal-leaning Supreme Court. It also wants to increase funding for lifelong rabbinical scholars and for religious schools that refuse to teach subjects such as maths and English. At the same time it proposes to slash projects beloved by secular Israelis, such as the public broadcasting corporation. “It feels like a government that is trying to do everything in its power to walk all over Israelis who work and pay the most taxes,” says one tech executive. So far Mr Netanyahu shows no sign of dropping his plans. His government’s stability relies on the support of his far-right political partners. Meanwhile, the prime minister, who is facing charges of bribery and fraud (allegations he strenuously denies), has his own reasons for opposing Israel’s legal establishment. But the latest accusations—that he is imperilling Israel’s economic success—now preoccupy him. In recent weeks violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has soared. Dozens of Palestinians have been killed there by Israeli security forces. On January 27th a Palestinian gunman killed seven Israelis in Jerusalem. Yet despite such horrors Mr Netanyahu has stepped up a social-media campaign to focus on the economy. Mr Netanyahu once again told business leaders in Tel Aviv that his policies were the source of Israel’s economic success and a guarantee of future growth. His political rivals were running a “scare campaign” to deter investors, he said. Thousands of investors were staying away from Israel because of “legal interference”, he insisted. His reforms were designed only to help boost Israel’s economy. So far there are few signs that it is foundering. It grew by more than 6% in 2022. Whether Mr Netanyahu’s plans will slow it down remains to be seen. ■
