Letters are welcome via e-mail to letters@economist.com Your article on why South Korea is reluctant to provide ammunition directly to Ukraine omitted the most influential factor: public opinion (“Arms and the Man”, February 4th). There is no strong public support for such action. The vast majority of South Koreans strongly condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and feel empathy for Ukrainians. They do back supplying Ukraine with humanitarian aid. The fear is that by sending ammunition directly to Ukraine we are just one stepping stone from military involvement. South Korea’s participation in the Vietnam war began by sending aid. That was followed by dispatching non-combat soldiers, and then the deployment of at least 200,000 fully fighting troops. And unlike Vietnam, South Koreans do not see the incentive in engaging in a war in a distant land. Nor does the Ukraine war create a security anxiety for South Koreans. Ukraine’s political and economic interactions with South Korea are almost non-existent. Trade between both countries is a smidgen of South Korea’s overall international trade. If NATO wants South Korea to take on more responsibilities it needs to give a more concrete and appealing reason than the abstract cause of maintaining the rules-based world order. I’m sure South Koreans would respond positively to such persuasion, as they did in the Vietnam war. Jee-Kwang ParkLecturerSchool of International StudiesKorea UniversitySeoul Seoul is 746km (463 miles) from Vladivostok. It has a valid security reason to avoid aggravating Russia. Demanding that South Korea send weapons to Ukraine is like demanding that European countries totally abandon Russian oil and gas. These are complex matters. Joseph KoSeoul ChatGPT is indeed impressive, but “The battle for search” (February 11th) is far from over. To understand why, consider that AI depends on network effects. To increase its (artificial) intelligence, an algorithm needs loops of predictions and responses. As you point out, ChatGPT was built on a large but outdated data set. Worse, you can’t ring the alarm bell when it provides hallucinatory answers. To increase its nous, OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, is obliged to seek user responses. Hopefully, Microsoft’s customers will oblige. The broader lesson is that even the best algorithm depreciates quickly without feedback. Google has both users and their data. So any obituary for its search engine will be premature. Dinkar JainMeta’s former head of artificial intelligence for ads and director of product development University of California, Los Angeles Professor Sheen S. LevineUniversity of Texas, Dallas Bagehot described well the ways in which a “second economy” of capitalist entrepreneurship can breed corruption (January 28th). The best regular assessment of public perceptions of corruption is Transparency International’s index. The latest edition shows Britain sliding to its worst-ever score: 18th out of 180 countries examined. It lost five points on the index: Azerbaijan, Myanmar, Oman and Qatar also dropped by at least that much. Corruption can start slowly. As it develops it gets its tentacles round institutions and destroys the belief of citizens in public and private services and the people who provide them. But it is ignited from the top, with citizens following the example of leaders. They may start off by believing in their leaders and their promises, but end up despising both. By that time, it may be too late to vote them out. A decent, democratic culture should not need endless watchdogs and “tsars” to monitor public conduct. It needs to get good people into leadership and respect them for dismissing those whose conduct doesn’t measure up. Sir Edward ClayEpsom, Surrey “On the edge” (February 18th) referred to Moldova as a “tiny former Soviet republic”. It has been 31 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and many people, including myself, have no memory of that era. Instead, we are focused on the present and future. So we are best defined as a candidate country to join the European Union, reform-oriented and freedom-loving. Moldova has made significant progress in recent years in implementing reforms to strengthen the rule of law, fight corruption and improve the business climate. We are proud to be part of the European family and to be working towards deeper integration with the EU. Our history is important, but it is time to put the cliché of Moldova as a former Soviet republic to bed. Olga RoscaChief of staff to the foreign minister of MoldovaChisinau, Moldova Regarding Potosí in Bolivia, the town produced about half the world’s silver in the century following the discovery of the metal there in 1545 and became the largest city in the Americas, with a population close to 150,000 (“Boom or bust?”, January 21st). But the mines did not become depleted in the mid-17th century and Potosí did not become a ghost town. Silver production was revived in the 18th century. Rather than being an illustration of a short-lived boom and bust, Potosí is a great example in the history of economic relations between Latin America and China. By the 16th century Potosí was exporting silver to China in exchange for silks, porcelain and other luxuries. DARIUSZ WOJCIKProfessor of economic geographyUniversity of Oxford I enjoyed Johnson’s musings on fake and real etymology (February 4th). Bil, the standard word for car in Danish, came about as the result of a survey in 1902 in a newspaper, which invited readers to vote on niftier synonyms for automobil (automobile). Speakers of American-English have gone with the first half of that word, bile not being to their taste, one assumes. Thorkil KjemsConcord, Massachusetts Ledikeni is a popular sweet in West Bengal in India and Bangladesh. It is, named after Lady Canning, the wife of Charles Canning, the governor general of India from 1856 to 1862. Chinmay HotaBhubaneswar, India The “Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology” is an endlessly fascinating storybook, telling the tales of the journeys certain words have taken to become what they are today. For many it has been a circuitous route. “Gossamer” is a favourite. It is believed to be a combination of “gos” (goose) and “sumer” (summer) that refers to the silken webs insects weave across the sheared stalks of a harvested field in an Indian summer, the time of year when geese are in season. Margaret McGirrGreenwich, Connecticut I was surprised that Johnson didn’t mention “Roger’s Profanisaurus”. This erudite publication has grown from a supplement of Viz, a comic, with 700 rude words and phrases, to a full-blown edition with over 20,000 vulgar definitions. I will spare readers of The Economist the subtitle of the 2018 edition. Paul LynchHong Kong
