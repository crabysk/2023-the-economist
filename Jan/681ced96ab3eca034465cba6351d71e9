2023 ought to be a big year in America’s transition towards electric vehicles. The federal government has set aside billions to encourage consumers and manufacturers to hitch a ride, and to ramp up the nation’s charging infrastructure. What do electric vehicles tell us about the future of American industry? On a road trip across the Midwest we look at whether America’s industrial and environmental goals are compatible. We visit a factory making a battery-powered version of a popular truck. Ethan Karp from MAGNET talks about the prospects for a manufacturing renaissance in what some rudely call the rustbelt.
