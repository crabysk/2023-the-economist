The surprise resignation on January 19th of Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s widely-loved prime minister, could have triggered bloodletting in the country’s ruling Labour Party. But it has selected a new leader with remarkably little fuss. Within two days of Ms Ardern’s announcement, Labour MPs had coalesced behind Chris Hipkins, the education minister. He was formally endorsed as Labour leader on January 22nd and will be sworn in as prime minister on January 25th. “Leadership contests don’t have to be like the Hunger Games,” the diminutive Mr Hipkins quipped. No dramatic change of course is expected of him. The 44-year-old Mr Hipkins is a close friend and ally of Ms Ardern, whom he hailed as “one of our great prime ministers”. He also borrowed one of her lines, promising to govern with “the heart”. Mr Hipkins has a reputation in Wellington, New Zealand’s capital, for quiet competence, says Ben Thomas, a former adviser to the opposition National Party. During Labour’s two terms in power, he has been given a series of problems to manage. As health minister, he was in charge of implementing New Zealand’s stringent response to covid-19, one of Ms Ardern’s best-known–and recently most contentious–policies. Last year, as the government tried to tackle an uptick in gang violence and robbery, Mr Hipkins was made minister of police. Mr Hipkins will replace Ms Ardern’s deputy prime minister, Grant Robertson, with Carmel Sepuloni, the current minister for social development. She will be the first politician of Pacific ancestry (Samoan and Tongan) to hold the job. A more extensive cabinet reshuffle is expected to follow. The goodwill towards Ms Ardern in her party is unfeigned. New Zealand politicos are not used to the global popularity she achieved, as a charismatic cheerleader for progressive values and moderation. Still, her popularity has waned, as voters’ erstwhile approval of Ms Ardern’s covid-19 policies–which helped her win an impressive majority in 2020–has given way to a familiar gripe about high inflation (currently around 7%). A recent survey suggests Ms Ardern’s net approval rating is slightly negative. Her main opponent, Christopher Luxon, leader of the centre-right National Party, had the same rating. Labour has been trailing National in the polls for months, by currently 32% to 37%. With an election due in October, Mr Hipkins spell as prime minister could be brief. He has vowed to recover his party’s standing by focusing on“bread-and-butter issues that people care about”. That, he says, will include tackling the “pandemic of inflation” and making “the tax system fairer”. In reality, his best chance of signalling a change of tack will lie in abandoning a clutch of unpopular reforms that Ms Ardern had been pushing. An expensive merger between the country’s national television and radio broadcasters is likely to be scrapped. Unpopular legislation to overhaul management of the country’s water infrastructure—which has enraged conservatives and left other voters cold—may also be reconsidered. That could be enough to put Labour back into contention. Mr Luxon, a former chief executive of Air New Zealand, looks beatable. And Mr Hipkins, a strawberry-blond known to his colleagues as “Chippy”, has a down-to-earth, self-deprecating manner that Kiwis tend to like. Covid-19 management aside, he may be best known for subsisting on a diet of cola and sausage rolls. And for those Kiwis who crave another trailblazer at the helm, the strawberry-blonde Mr Hipkins has an identity-political appeal all of his own. “It’s about time we had a ginger at the top”, he joshed, after he was nominated to replace Ms Ardern.■
