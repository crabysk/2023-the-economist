The Economist is looking to hire an international economics correspondent, ideally based at first in London. Journalistic experience is not necessary. The ability to write clearly and entertainingly is crucial. So is a thorough understanding of economics—including current-account and sovereign-debt crises—and an ability to work with data. The writer will be responsible for coverage of global trade; stresses in poor- and middle-income countries; and the intersection of economics and geopolitics. All beats at The Economist are somewhat malleable according to the skills and interests of the writer. The correspondent will frequently collaborate with country correspondents and the rest of the economics team where responsibilities overlap. They will be expected to appear on podcasts and films and at Economist events. Applicants should send a CV and a sample article, suitable for publication in The Economist, to: economicsjob@economist.com. It should be unpublished and no longer than 700 words. Some examples of relevant coverage are listed below. The deadline is February 18th. Example coverage The 53 fragile emerging economies Globalisation and autocracy are locked together.
