Gerard piqué was one of Spain’s most talented footballers. On January 11th his ex-partner, Shakira, a Colombian singer, made him better-known for infidelity than ball-control. “I’m worth two 22-year-olds,” blasts a new song that takes aim at Mr Piqué and his younger lover. “You traded a Ferrari for a [Renault] Twingo, swapped a Rolex for a Casio.” The gym-honed Mr Piqué should “work his brain a little bit too”. On YouTube, a video-streaming platform, the superstar’s song broke records, reaching 100m views in only three days. The producer behind her, Gonzalo Julián Conde, is also topping charts. The 24-year-old Argentine dJ, known by his stage name, Bizarrap, has amassed more than 6bn views on YouTube since 2017. This hit is a pop song. But he is the most successful of a group of young Argentines finding global fame in the genre known as “trap”. A cousin of hip-hop, this emerged in Atlanta in the 1990s and was popularised by artists from crime-ridden neighbourhoods—the name alludes to ”trap houses”, where drugs are sold. It has swept the hemisphere, and “freestyle” (improvised) rap concerts became very popular in Buenos Aires in the mid-2010s. It helped that the government provided a free laptop to every student at public secondary schools, allowing them to record their first tracks, even if exam results were no better. The undisputed king of Latin trap is from Puerto Rico: Bad Bunny, the most-streamed artist for three years in a row on Spotify, the world’s biggest music-streaming platform. But Argentina is catching up. Its singers tend to be younger, and many of them are women, says Leila Cobo, the chief content officer for Latin music at Billboard, an American music magazine. Bizarrap is an exception: it is often women—particularly María Becerra and Nicki Nicole, both 22—who have gained fame abroad. Argentina’s musical rise is part of a broader globalisation of Latin music. In 2016 none of the top 50 most-played tracks on Spotify was in Spanish. Last year, 14 were. In 2021 the recorded-music market grew by 31% in Latin America, far above the global average of 18.5%. According to gWI, a market-research firm, Latin Americans lead the world in the average time spent streaming songs—almost two hours a day. Unlike their tough American counterparts, many Argentine trap artists are middle-class. Lyrics focus less on drugs and violence; more on bonking, brands and bottoms. “I’m a nasty girl, fantastic/This bum is natural, no plastic,” boasts Nathy Peluso, an Argentine singer, in a song with Bizarrap. An analysis of 692 songs by the 20 biggest Argentine trap artists showed that the most-mentioned names were Lionel Messi, a footballer, God and Robin Hood—and brands like Nike and Ferrari. Like Mr Piqué, brands, too, may soon find that Argentine artists make or mar their reputations. ■
