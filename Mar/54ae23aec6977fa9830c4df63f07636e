CHINA WAS THE source of $1trn-worth of electronic goods and components in 2021, roughly a third of the global total. And it’s not just consumer electronics that begin their life in China. The country is the source of everything from childrens’ toys to disposable cigarette lighters—it dominates the global supply chain.
