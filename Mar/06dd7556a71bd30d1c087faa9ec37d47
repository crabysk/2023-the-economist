PROGRESS IN LOWERING maternal mortality rates has stalled across much of the world and, in some regions, it is getting worse. A report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) published in February showed that between 2016 and 2020 the number of pregnant women who died per 100,000 births increased by 3.8% a year in Europe. Over the same period mortality rose by 3.5% annually in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 2.9% in North America. In other poorer regions, for the first time in decades, improvement slowed significantly. Around 70% of all maternal deaths in 2020 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. By the most recent figures, one in 40 women in the region dies during pregnancy or childbirth. Poverty is largely to blame. Many women do not have access to health care to deal with complications when they arise. Child marriage is also common. In some parts of the region 20% of women give birth before their 16th birthday, raising the risk of severe complications. Between 2000 and 2015 maternal mortality rates across Africa fell by around 2.2% each year. But since 2016 the annual drop has shrunk to 1.7%. Progress is stalling elsewhere, too. In Asia the rate has fallen by more than 60% since 2000. But after 2016 yearly improvements were around a third of what they were between 2000 and 2015. The reasons for this are still unclear. The pandemic no doubt made pregnancy more hazardous, because of the risk of covid-19 itself and the strain it put on health-care facilities. But that merely helps to explain one year of the data. Public-health experts are yet to determine what other factors have been at play since 2016. In some parts of the world progress has reversed. In percentage terms, Europe saw the greatest increase of any region in the maternal death rate between 2016 and 2020 (though it is still by far the safest region to be pregnant or give birth). Latin America and the Caribbean also experienced a rise in mortality, after more than a decade of improvements. Many countries in the region suspended or limited access to maternal-health services during the pandemic. The WHO’s next update could be even grimmer, as the full toll of the pandemic emerges. America is an outlier in the rich world. Unlike most other countries it has recorded a steady rise in mortality rates for the past two decades, not just since 2016. Black women are disproportionately affected: studies have shown they are three times more likely to die during pregnancy than white women. The WHO’s figures show that the risk for a woman in America was 78% higher in 2020 than in 2000. But America’s data are skewed by the fact that, between 2003 and 2017, states changed how they recorded maternal mortality rates. New death certificates were introduced which identify whether a woman was pregnant at, or shortly before, their death—regardless of the cause. A report published in 2020 found there was no difference in the maternal-mortality rate between 1999 and 2017 when controlling for the adoption of these new death certificates. There are caveats to the WHO report. But, overall, it provides a gloomy assessment of the risks pregnant women face globally.■
